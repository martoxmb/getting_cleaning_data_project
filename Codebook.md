### Labeling Tidy Data set ###
 * prefix t from original data is replaced with Time
 * prefix f from original data is replaced with Freq
 * -mean and -std along with folowing () are replaced with Mean and Std
 * BodyBody is replaced with Body
 
 
### Tidy Data set Variables ###

 * `Subject_number` - IDs of 30 volunteers that participated in the experiment
 * `Activity` - Activities performed by volunteers during the experiment
